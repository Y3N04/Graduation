          <h2>To Darl:</h2>
          <p>Hello Darl and congratulations on your graduation, i dont really know how to start this letter but i guess i will just start by saying that i am so proud of your achievements and all the hard work you have put into your studies. i know that this might be too late to express how i feel but i guess its better than never. I dont really know how to express how much i appreciate the time we have spent together even though its was quite short, i have enjoyed every moment of it. I dont really know what i should say at this point sorry if this letter might be a bit too long or too short but then again i am not really good at writing letters. So i hope you can forgive my grammar and spelling mistakes.<br> Once again i just want to say congratulations on graduating and i hope that one day you will finally be able to achieve your dreams and goals in life. I mean i already know that you will be able to do it because you are a very smart and hardworking person. If theres one thing that i regret is that i never got to know you that well and probably the times that i never go and went to see you every time i had the chance to.<br><br> I know this letter might be a bit cringe cause of the random things im saying that i cant truly say to you in person due to my poor social skills HHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA. But then i just really want to tell you that im really proud of you and ill continue to be proud of you even though i cant really express it in person and i just want to let you know that even though that we never talk that much like before ill be here to support and to listen to you whenever you need someone to talk to or just someone to listen to your problems. Maybe one day our paths will cross again and we can talke about all the things that we have missed out on, i mean only if you want to im not forcing you to if you dont want to. I just really want to tell you that ill be here to support you even if not anywhere near you.<br><br> Once again i just want to say Congratulations and i wish you all the best </p>
